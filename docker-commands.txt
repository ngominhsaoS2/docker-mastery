19. Starting a Nginx Web Server
Image is biraries, libraries, source code ... we want to run
Container is a running instance of an Image
We can have many Containers running based on one Image

docker container run --publish 8888:80 nginx :will do below things:
   - downloads Image 'nginx' from Docker Hub
   - starts a new Container form this Image
   - Opens port 80 on the host IP (in this case, my mac, my physical mac)
   - routes traffic to the container IP, port 8888
   - then we open browser and go to localhost:8888, it will go to nginx home page

ctrl + C :to stop the container
docker container ls :list all running containers
docker container ls -a :list all containers
docker container stop <container id> :to stop a running container
docker container run always starts a NEW container
docker container start to start an existing stopped container

docker container run --publish 8888:80 --detach --name <container name> nginx :to detach the random name, and name the new container
docker container logs <container name or id> :view container logs
docker container top <container name or id> :list processes of the running container
docker container rm <list container IDs> :remove containers
