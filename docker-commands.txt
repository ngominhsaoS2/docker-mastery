19. Starting a Nginx Web Server
Image is biraries, libraries, source code ... we want to run
Container is a running instance of an Image
We can have many Containers running based on one Image

docker container run --publish 8888:80 nginx :will do below things:
   - find the Image locally, if does not find, then downloads Image 'nginx' (latest version) from Docker Hub
   - starts a new Container form this Image
   - Opens port 80 on the host IP, --publish (in this case, my mac, my physical mac)
   - routes traffic to the container IP, port 8888
   - then we open browser and go to localhost:8888, it will go to nginx home page

ctrl + C :to stop the container
docker container ls :list all running containers (docker ps)
docker container ls -a :list all containers
docker container stop <container id> :to stop a running container
docker container run always starts a NEW container
docker container start to start an existing stopped container

docker container run --publish 8888:80 --detach --name <container name> nginx :to detach the random name, and name the new container
docker container logs <container name or id> :view container logs
docker container top <container name or id> :list processes of the running container
docker container rm <list container IDs> :remove containers


24. Assignment Answers: Manage Multiple Containers
docker container run -d -p 3307:3306 --name db -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql (cuz port 3306 is already used by local mysql app)
docker container run -d --name webserver -p 8080:80 httpd
docker container run -d --name proxy -p 8888:80 nginx (cuz port 80 is already used by local nginx process)

Here is steps to check:
   - curl localhost:8888 (to test nginx)
   - curl localhost:8080 (to test apache/httpd)

docker image ls :list all local Images
-d :it's the short version of --detach. By running in detached mode, we are able to have access to our command line when the container spins up and runs. Without it, we would have logs constantly fed onto the screen.
You didn't specify the -d flag to detach it in the background, and there aren't any logs coming across the screen because you haven't connected to the published port yet, so Nginx has nothing to log about.


25. What's Going On In Containers: CLI Process Monitoring
docker container top :list processes in one container
docker container inspect :details of one container configuration
docker container stats :performance stats for all container
